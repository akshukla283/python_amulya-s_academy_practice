    "* In directed graph we stores only directed adjecent value.\n",

    "* in multiple edge grap we need to store the number of edge connection between two nodes instead of storeing 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* no need to change in `add_node()` function because we adding new node that doesn't have any connection between the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But in `add_edge()` funciton instead of storing 1 we can take a counter initially it will be zero when ther is single edge between two node we can make it one but when add second edge between same vertices than make counter as 2 and increase it whenever the new edge will be added between same nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `delete_node()` no need to make any changes becasue when we delete node then we need to delete all the edges connected to that that's why it doesn't affect whether there are multiple edges between two nodes or only one edge is preset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* But in `delete_edge()` we need to deacreament the counter.\n",

    "* But performig the delete_node() funtion we need to careful because what we are doing is we delete node so there might be multiple edge which is present in nested list as value of a dictionary so we need to do some changes in previous function to remove all the edges.\\\n",
