    "### Big O Notation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "`Considering the sheer amount of data processed nowadays, the time and space used by algorithms should be efficient.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Computational Complexity is the study of algorithms on the basis of the number of resources it requires to operate. Time Complexity is a method to calculate the amount of time an algorithm requires to run.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time Complexity is estimated by counting the number of elementary operations processed by the algorithm, assuming that each elementary operation takes up a fixed amount of time to process.\n",
    "Big O Notation is also called Asymptotic Notation. It is a mathematical notation that describes the study of the limiting nature of a function when the arguments tend towards a value or infinity.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need Big O Notation?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Big O Notation is used to analyze algorithms on the basis of the increase in the time they take to run with an increasing input size (denoted by n). Thus functions with the same growth rates will have the same Big O notations.`\n",

    "It mathematically describes the upper bound or worst-case scenarios of algorithm time complexities and compares them.\n",

    "#### Definition\n",
